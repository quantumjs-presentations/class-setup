# Pre-setup

To help you track the state of the application please add the following JavaScript expression watches to your Browser of choice.

In Google Chrome you can do it like this:

* Open the dev tools (alt + cmd + I) and click on the sources tab.
* Navigate to the watch tab (next to the scope tab)

* Add the following watch expressions:
  - item
  - typeof item
  - item.toString()
  - watch
  - item2
  - myObj
  - hostElement
  - i

No worries if don't have this setup before I begin. We can also set it up in the class.
Chrome is normally pretty good at showing you the application state inline with the code, but I find that using watches is easier to track.
